A front-end project that has been built using vanilla HTML and CSS, I built the project on a platform called firebase, it was a fun build and I am doing more in the future.

The design was from a platform called FrontendMentor one of the best platforms to get a designs if you're like me, not too creative, I think this was a good project I learnt how
turn a figma design to code lastly I'd like to admit it was a lengthy process than I enitially thought it would be.
